# ava-bot
A Discord bot to chill in the Saxy Beast's server. Her name is Ava (after the AI in Ex Machina)

Check out <https://discord.js.org> for more information about the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module I used to make the bot. You can install it with `npm install --save discord.js`

Before you can run the bot, you will need to make a file in the same directory called `auth.json` that contains the bot's access token (Don't leak this, I know from experience) and the bot's ID. You can get the ID in Discord Developer mode. 
`auth.json` should look like this:
```
{
   "token": "YOUR-TOKEN-HERE",
   "myID": "YOUR-ID-HERE"
}
```
